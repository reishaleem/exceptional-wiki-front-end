## About

This is the front-end of a web application that uses React, Spring Boot, and MongoDB. This application currently allows users to create accounts in order to create wiki-styled articles for aspects of their stories. The articles can be about anything, from characters to locations to events. The back end can be found [here](https://github.com/reishaleem/exceptional-wiki-back-end).

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Tools and Technologies used

In this front-end, the key technologies and dependencies used are:

- React
- Bootstrap
- axios
- react-router
- react-hook-form. This is mainly how some basic validation is done.
- Atomic Design. I don't adhere to the principles _perfectly_, but I try to make an effort.

## Implemented features

So far, the features implemented in this front-end are:

- Screens for CRUD operations on Users
- Screens for public information, routing, as well as redirects to avoid logged out users from accessing pages that require being logged in

## Planned features

Some features that will be implemented are:

- Screens for CRUD operations on several other models, with Universe and Wiki getting priority
- A screen for the Generator
